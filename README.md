## Introduction

This is a fully functional online store designed for selling T-shirts. It allows customers to easily browse and view a wide selection of products. Key features of the webshop include:

* Product display with descriptions and images

The website is designed to offer a seamless shopping experience with smooth navigation from product selection to final purchase and delivery.

This project utilizes a PHP MVC architecture (Model-View-Controller) with object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.
